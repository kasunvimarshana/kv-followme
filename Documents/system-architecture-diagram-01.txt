' Notes
note right of Laravel
  **Security Concerns**
  - Laravel 8 (2020 release)
  - No visible rate limiting
  - Basic auth implementation
end note

note right of Storage
  **Missing Features**
  - File upload endpoints
  - Attachment management UI
  - S3 integration
end note

note bottom of Queue
  **Technical Debt**
  - jobs table exists
  - No worker configuration
  - No failed job handling
end note
